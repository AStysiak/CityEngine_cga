# Esri CityEngine .cga Examples

The following are a collection of Esri's CityEngine .cga rule files for constructing 3D landscapes.

They were accumulated via CityEngine's tutorials.

## Notes
I do not own and did not author any of this code - All accolades to the staff at CityEngine / ESRI.

I only needed a central location to host the code since I was unable to find anything else posted.

I hope this helps others!
